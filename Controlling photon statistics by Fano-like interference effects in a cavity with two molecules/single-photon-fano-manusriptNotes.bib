@MISC{Note1,note="Fano interference is caused by the interference between a discrete state and a continuous state. Here, the excitation of the molecule $m$ and the cavity mode act as the discrete state and continuous state, respectively. However, for the cavity with low-dissipation, both channels are discrete states, so we name this effect as Fano-like interference effect."}
